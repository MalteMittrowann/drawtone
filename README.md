Master project 1 of Dave Kronawitter and Malte Mittrowann in the master degree programme on MultiMediaArts at the FH Salzburg.

Goal:

Interactive performance where participants draw colorful pictures with pens and paper with which they can interactively control the music.

There will only be one button, to start the scanning of the picture, and one knob to control the length of the morph time.

Otherwise the music is completely controlled by the pictures that people draw.
